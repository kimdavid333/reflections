Question: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do
it?

    First of all, anyone can initialize a repository by using the command, git init.
    What it does is it creates a directory to contain all the metadata, which I
    understood so far as some sort of data that reflects all the history of
    commits within this repository. 
    The interesting thing about this 'git init' is that once you initialize a
    repository, there is no commit taking place even if the working directory
    already contains some files. The reason for this sort of implementation is
    to allow:
    1) To allow user to set all the files of repository by letting them make
    first commit himself.
    2) Git does not want to accidentally set dependencies among files that are
    not meant to be in that repository. 
    3) It goes against its philosophy which is to allow the user to define its
    saving point - by committing, manually. This idea contrast to Google Docs'
    implementation of auto-save.

Question: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is different in a sense that it is not "real", meaning it is not an 
actual storage where bunch of files reside in. Rather, staging area is an
abstraction that enable git's core philosophy of: one commit represent one
logical change. As a logical change can take multiple files to be represented, a
programmers can simply add these files to stage area where they can be committed
as one. Notice that if stage area was not available, each commit can only
operations on one file as well. Then for the most of time, each commit will be
only represent partial changes rather a whole logical change. 
======================================================================================
Question:How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

Git introduced staging area so that users can represent multiple files as one
logical change which often is the case. For instance, let's suppose you are
adding a new feature in your own project. It is very possible, and often is the
case, that in order to add the new feature you need to modified multiple files.
Then you can represent this whole change as one logical change by putting all
the modified files in staging area.

Question: What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping
your history organized? How would branches help?

One such situation could occur when you are

Question: How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Well, diagrams let you grasp many important attributes of the structure. First,
	it let you see the reachability of a certain node with respect to others.
	Second, it shows how many branches are there as well as the point in the
	history tree where branches diverge from each other. 

======================================================================================
Question: What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we
represent it in the diagram the way we do?

The resulting branch combines changes from both branches. The distinctive
feature of the diagram was that the resulting tip of merged branches has two
parents. This is correct representation as the resulting files in a repository
reflects the end results from both branches. Therefore we should be able to
reach all these commits and revert to old versions if we desired to do so.

Question: What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing
merges manually?

First, let's talk about Git way of automatic merging. Benefits include providing
convenience and saving lots of time for its users, assuming everything works
correctly. Automatic merging also encourage users to experiment and diverge from
its production level development (master branch) into a new branch as merging is
done efficiently. On the other hands, users do not always have total control
behind the merging process and thus possible errors might occur without them
knowing. 

Other approach, which is to merge manually, give users total control over the
merging process. Hence, other than possible human errors, no other errors should
be introduced and things would work as expected. Cons of this approach is that
the process takes lots of time and difficult and tedious. Notice that bigger the
project, they is more chance of messing up and this wouldn't be a popular
approach to merge branches.
