Question: When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Creating a remote repository would allow one to share and collaborate his/her works with public. 
The shortcoming of keeping all your work local is that although it is still great to work on a big project
alone, local repository does not have proper services to allow a user to share work with public.

Question: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Contrast to working on local computer, GitHub typically is used to share codes
with public or to collaborate with other members. As a result, it's very natural for
users to be very careful on what to post on his/her remote repository. For this
very reason, making Git manually pull changes is much more desirable than
automatically stay up-to-date with one's remote repository.
	For instance, suppose you are working on a large project with many contributors,
and you and your friends are working on a side branch to add a new feature to
the program. If Git automatically synchronize its remote repository with your
not-yet-ready-to-share codes, everyone would be able to see your sub-optimal
code. More importantly, your new feature branch could be a mess if all the
changes from other contributors get updated automatically, and therefore causing
unpredictable codes.
